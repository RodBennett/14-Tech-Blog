## Overview

In this full-stack MVC application, I created a tech blog where users can sign up, log in, create new posts, edit posts, and comment on others' posts.

WHEN I revisit the site at a later time and choose to sign in
THEN I am prompted to enter my username and password
WHEN I am signed in to the site
THEN I see navigation links for the homepage, the dashboard, and the option to log out
WHEN I click on the homepage option in the navigation
THEN I am taken to the homepage and presented with existing blog posts that include the post title and the date created

## Contributing
As this was a project for the University of Denver bootcamp, no outside contributions are being accepted at this time.

## Challenges
This was definitely the most challenging assignment of the bootcamp so far.  The first challenge was learning how to tease out back-end routes from front-end ones.  That in itself was a major obstacle that took me considerable amounts of time to understand.  The second challenge was in Handlebars itself, which, combined with routes, made for some difficult programming.  On the the other hand, no assignment has taught me more about back-end development than this one, and even though I am aware that Handlebars is hardly ever used in the development community, I am confident that the logic behind this assignemnt will come in handy for all of my full-stack development projects.

## Future Development
In the future, I would like to add more styling to this blog to make the UI better.
